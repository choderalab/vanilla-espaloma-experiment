# Protein-ligand vanilla MD using espaloma-0.3
This repository includes scripts to run vanilla MD using `espaloma-0.3`.


## Description
The robustness and stability of `espaloma-0.3` is tested by running simple vanilla MD simulations of a protein-ligand complex system (Tyk2 protein).
The RMSD profiles of heavy ligand atoms and C-alpha protein atoms are monitored. 
`espaloma-0.3` is used to parametrize both the protein and ligand, and `openff-2.0.0` is used to assign the LJ parameters. 
As a control experiment, the ligand and protein is parametrized with `openff-2.1.0` and Amber `ff14SB`, respectively.
The initial Tyk2 protein and ligand structures are taken from the custom alchemical protein-ligand binding benchmark dataset (https://github.com/kntkb/protein-ligand-benchmark-custom).
